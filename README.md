# employee-list
  ## Description
  This is an app that creates a list of your team members on a new webpage. It starts by asking questions about the manager of your team and then asks if you would like to add another member and you can either create an intern or an engineer. You can create as many employees as you like. For all of them it asks their name, ID number, and email address. For the Manager it asks for their office number, engineer asks for their GitHub, and intern asks for their school. After all the questions it will add a new index.html, and copy an existing style sheet to the dist folder.
